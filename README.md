# A Telegram BOT to convert images in PDF's files


the main idea in write this app is to improve my docker skills. But i think this can be userful for others tough.

to use any telegram bot, you'll need a token (if you don't know what i'm talking about, just google it.). 
In my app i store this token in a file called credencial.py. For this container works, create a credencial.py file and put your own token before build the image.  

feel free to change the code or improve it.
